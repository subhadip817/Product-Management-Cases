You’ve recently joined WinZo as a PM.

1. Every Product has certain segments of users known as “ Power Users ”, “ Churned
Users ”, “ New Users ”. Define “New User”, “Power Users” and “Churned Users” for
WinZo
  a. Power Users are the ones who use a product frequently. For e.g., in the case of
Uber, a user completing 3 cab rides a week can be termed a “Power User”
  b. Churned Users are the ones who are no longer using the product. For e.g., a
user who has not booked a cab in the last 15 days after her last cab ride can be
termed as a “Churned User” for Uber
2. Suggest 2 Product solutions to move a user from a New User to a Power User for
WinZo. Provide UI mocks/flow charts and explain the feature in detail (Balsamiq/Figma
wireframes preferred)
  a. For the above, provide the metrics you will track
3. Suggest 2 solutions to move a user from Churned User to a Resurrected User
