Youâ€™ve recently joined MX TakaTak as a PM.

One of the challenges which every content platform faces is converting its users into creators
of content. For e.g., on Instagram, a creator can be a user who posts a photo, uploads a video,
story, etc. Similarly, a creator on YouTube is a user who uploads videos.

The other challenge is creator retention (keeping the creator active, i.e., keep
uploading/posting content)

As a strategic decision maker, you have to work towards building at least 1 product solution
each for Conversion and Retention of creators on MX TakaTak.

1. Provide UI mocks/flow charts and explain the solution in detail (Balsamiq/Figma wireframes
preferred)
2. Identify the goal that you are trying to achieve
3. Describe how the solution facilitates the goal
4. Identify metrics that would help you measure whether a feature is achieving its goal or not.
