You recently joined Cure.fit as a Product Lead. You’ve joined at a time when there’s a lockdown
and all Cult.fit centres are closed. Cure.fit started with the concept of group workouts (Cult.fit)
and gradually added other relevant use cases like Eat.fit, Mind.fit, etc. Group workouts do well
because people get motivated when they see others working out harder than them.

Fitness subscribers are already a fickle bunch and hard to engage, and the lockdown makes
things worse. As a Product Lead at Cure.fit, what would you do to retain, delight and engage
your users through product?

1. What are the top Product initiatives would you consider?
2. How would you measure the performance of your initiatives?
