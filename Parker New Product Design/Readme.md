You recently joined as the first PM at a hypothetical company Parker .

Car parking is a pain for commuters in Indian cities. Parker allows you to find car parking spaces
in your area. You must come up with the MVP in the next 3 months.

1. What is the Total Addressable Market for your Product?
(Also mention will you launch pan India? Or a particular city/area? Why?)
2. How will you go about finding the early adopters?
3. What are the features/value propositions which will go in your MVP?
(Kindly detail/spec out the ideas along with wireframes and feel free to add flow charts or
state diagrams as required)
4. What will be your monetisation strategy?
(Will it be a marketplace? Will it be a curated parking space owned/managed by you?
Why?)
