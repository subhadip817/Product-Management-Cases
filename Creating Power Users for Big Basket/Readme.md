As a PM at BigBasket the task is to ensure the next phase
of growth. It is needed to create Power Users, i.e., users who are super-loyal to BigBasket.

1. Come up with 3 Product solutions to drive this. Think Big!
   (Avoid solutions like push notification, email, UI tweaks, etc.) 
   (Hint - Check out what is happening in grocery tech across the world)
2. For any 2 of 3 solutions, provide wireframes and explain the solution in detail
(Balsamiq/Figma wireframes preferred)
3. Align metrics for the above 2 solutions
 (Avoid writing HEART Metrics just for the sake of it)
4. Publish a press-release (blog post) announcing the launch of your initiatives
