You have recently joined as a PM at Meesho. 

You have observed that 60% users (i.e.,
resellers) leave the platform after the first 7 days of doing their first sale.

As a PM, you have to enable the resellers to sell more. Selling more means more revenue for
Meesho. Also, by selling more, a reseller will trust the platform more. Hence, stick around longer
on the platform.

Suggest 2 new big features that can be added which will help increase selling via Meesho.

Describe your suggested features and their respective value proposition both to the user
(reseller) and to the end customer. Please ensure that you:
1. Provide UI mocks/flow charts and explain each feature in detail (Balsamiq/Figma wireframes
preferred)
2. Describe how these feature facilitates the goal of enabling the resellers to sell more
3. Identify metrics that would help you measure whether a feature is achieving its goal or not
4. Identify metrics that may be negatively impacted and explain how you would monitor them
