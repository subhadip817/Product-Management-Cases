StepSetGo has been experiencing drop offs for users after sign ups. This means users
download the app, signup and have the first session on the app but then never come back to
the app. Assume that you have acquired the right users on the application. So, this is not an
acquisition targeting problem. But due to some reason, users do not come back. Also, this is not
to be thought of as a technical implementation problem.

Almost 35â„… of the new users drop off on day 1 and do not return the next day. This number falls
down further and we have only 20% of the users still retained after day 2. Looking at the current
product experience, could you come up with solutions on how could these drop offs be
reduced? Please note that these numbers are hypothetical .

Please do not suggest engagement emails, in-app communication, push notification, etc. to
drive retention and reduce the drop off rates. You could suggest new features.
You could also study a few competitors to see if there are any best practices which could be
adopted for the first few days on a user coming onboard.

Deliverables:
1. A report (PPT/PDF) on the solutions which you propose
2. Any wireframes which are relevant
3. Success criteria and what will you measure
