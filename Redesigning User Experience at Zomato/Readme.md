You recently joined as the Head of Product at Zomato. You did a round of user research and
came to the conclusion - Zomato has a lot of meaningful offerings like Pro, Food Ordering,
Market, Dine-In, Table Booking, etc. but none of the offerings stand out in particular. Thus, the
user feels slightly lost.

As the Head of Product, you decide to revamp the UX of Zomato.

As a first step, create wireframes in Figma/Balsamiq on how you envision the UX to be. Explain
why you believe the UX should be like the one you propose. While explaining, identify the
metrics which you think will improve because of the changes you propose.
