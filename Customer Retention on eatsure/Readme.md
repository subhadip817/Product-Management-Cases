Youâ€™ve been onboarded as a Product Manager at EatSure.

As of now, an average user has the 2 most common food ordering apps on her phone, i.e.,
Zomato and Swiggy. A considerable proportion of orders of all cloud kitchen companies like
Rebel Foods, etc. are processed via both these apps. An average user still prefers using
Zomato or Swiggy despite cloud kitchen companies having their own respective food ordering
apps.

As a strategic decision maker, you have to work towards building product solutions to drive
repeat purchase behaviour (Retention) on EatSure.

Describe your chosen solutions and the value proposition to the end user. Please ensure that
you:

1. Provide UI mocks/flow charts and explain the feature in detail (Balsamiq/Figma wireframes
preferred)
2. Identify the goal that you are trying to achieve
3. Describe how the solution facilitates the goal
4. Identify metrics that would help you measure whether a feature is achieving its goal or not
5. Identify metrics that may be negatively impacted and explain how you would monitor them
