You’ve recently joined as the Head of Product at a trekking company IndiaHikes, which
organises treks across India. You are able to convince the management to launch a mobile app.
Your task is to build the MVP in the near future.

1. What is the Total Addressable Market for your Product?
(Think user persona you’ll launch with)
2. What are the features/value propositions which will go in your MVP?
(Kindly detail/spec out the ideas along with wireframes and feel free to add flow charts or
state diagrams as required)
3. What will be your monetisation model?
(Organising trek is one monetisation model. What could be the other categories?)
